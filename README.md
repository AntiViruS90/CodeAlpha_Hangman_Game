# CodeAlpha_Hangman_Game

## Overview

Hangman is a console-based word guessing game written in Python. The player has **6 attempts** to guess a randomly selected word by suggesting one letter at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letter's positions in the word, while incorrect guesses advance the hangman drawing. The game ends when the word is fully guessed or all attempts are exhausted.

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list
- 6 attempts to guess the word
- ASCII art displaying the hangmanâ€™s progress
- Option to play again after each game
- Input validation for single letters and repeated guesses

## Requirements

## How to Play
